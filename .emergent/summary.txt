<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a modern, stylish, and animated portfolio website called Xhyz to showcase and sell Tibia maps.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- A gallery to display all available maps.
- A detail page for each map.
- Instead of direct payment, use contact buttons (Discord and WhatsApp) for inquiries and quotes.
- An admin panel for the user to upload, create, edit, and delete maps.
- The website must be bilingual (Portuguese and English).
- The design should be modern with smooth animations.
- Initial implementation can use simple image viewing, with advanced features like deep zoom to be considered later.

**User's preferred language**: Portuguese. The next agent MUST respond in Portuguese.

**what currently exists?**
A complete full-stack application has been built.
- **Frontend (React):** A fully functional user-facing website with a gallery, map detail page, and about page. It is integrated with the backend, fetching real data. It also includes a complete internationalization (i18n) system for Portuguese and English.
- **Admin Panel (React):** A secure section with login (), a dashboard to list maps (), and forms to create () and edit () maps, including multi-image uploads.
- **Backend (FastAPI):** A robust API with endpoints for public data fetching and protected admin actions (CRUD for maps). It uses a MongoDB database and JWT for authentication.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Fixing a visual glitch on the map cards in the homepage gallery. When hovering, a 1-pixel line appears at the bottom of the card, breaking the visual integrity of the shadow effect.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N (The agent's last attempt was not successful, as confirmed by its own thought process.)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Visual bug on map card hover (P0)**
  - **Description**: On the gallery page (), hovering over a map card causes a translation animation. During this animation, a small 1-pixel gap appears at the bottom of the card, disrupting the overlay/shadow effect.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Attempted fixes**: The agent tried adding CSS properties like ,  to the image, and  to the overlay within . This did not resolve the issue.
  - **Next debug checklist**:
      1. Inspect .
      2. The issue is likely that the gradient overlay () is not perfectly covering the card during the hover transform ().
      3. **Suggested Fix:** Instead of relying on , explicitly give the overlay a height slightly larger than the parent, e.g.,  or , and ensure it's positioned correctly to cover any gaps created by the transform. Another option is to apply the transform to an inner wrapper instead of the main card group.
  - **Why fix this issue?** It's a UI polish issue that detracts from the modern and stylish look the user requested.
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **Advanced Zoom Viewer (P2):** Implement a deep zoom viewer (e.g., OpenSeadragon) for map images on the detail page, as discussed in the initial clarification phase.
    - **AI Map Variants (P2):** Explore the possibility of using AI to generate map variants (e.g., Dark, Light, Old-school styles).

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Stack Scaffolding**: Built the complete React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Frontend Development**: Created all public-facing pages (Gallery, Map Detail, About) and layout components (Header, Footer).
- **Backend Development**: Implemented database models (Map, Admin), authentication (JWT), and all necessary API endpoints for map management and image uploads.
- **Admin Panel**: Developed a secure, full-featured admin area for the user to manage their map portfolio, including creation, editing, and deletion.
- **Backend Integration**: Successfully replaced all frontend mock data with live data from the backend API.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Implemented a complete translation system for Portuguese and English across all public pages.
- **Bug Fixes & User Feedback**:
    - Resolved critical backend login and authentication middleware bugs.
    - Fixed multiple issues with images not appearing on cards (CORS, CSS z-index).
    - Implemented user-requested features: changing price to on request, map size to categories, and adding a client field for sold maps.
    - Fixed UI contrast issues on link hovers.
    - Removed the Download Preview button as requested.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. The agent has addressed all issues raised by the user so far.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, React Context API, TailwindCSS, Axios
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor async driver), Pydantic, JWT
- **Authentication**: Token-based (JWT) for the admin panel.
- **File Handling**: Multipart file uploads for map images, stored locally on the server.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: A custom solution using React Context and a simple translation object.

**key DB schema**
- **maps**: 
- **admins**: 

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : This file contains the card component with the current visual bug.
- : Contains the core logic for protecting admin routes.
- : Manages the application's language state.
- : The form for creating and editing maps.
- : Defines the backend logic for map management.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- None critical. The i18n implementation is basic but sufficient for the current scope.

**key api endpoints**
- **Public:**
  - : Fetches all maps for the gallery.
  - : Fetches details for a single map.
- **Admin (Protected):**
  - : Admin login.
  - : Create a new map.
  - : Update an existing map.
  - : Delete a map.
  - : Upload an image file.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user is non-technical but provides excellent, specific feedback. Prioritize addressing their requests clearly and directly.
- The application is feature-complete for the MVP. The primary focus should be on polishing and bug-fixing.
- The admin credentials are hardcoded for seeding: , .

**documents created in this job**
- : Contains the initial plan for the backend and API structure.
